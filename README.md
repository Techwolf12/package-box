package-box
====

The goal of this project is to create a internet connected package box for postal services to deliver packages when you are not home. 
This project will feature a Cubecell LoRaWAN module along with the 3d models for the electronic enclosure and the specifications for the box itself.

Why? 
======
First off, why not! Mainly because it was a idea I had where I can work with metal, and I've been wanting to learn how to weld. 

Another reason, I've been missing a few packages lately, and the whole delivering the next day again is just wasted time and CO2! If we can improve on that, why shouldn't we? :)

Handy stuff
